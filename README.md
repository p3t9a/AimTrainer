# Aim Trainer
A small java application for improving your aim with the mouse. Great for personal development in shooter games.
## How it works?
- Multiple cirles are growing and shrinking in the middle of your screen
- You have to click on them and if you do they dissapear
- You gain a point each time you destroy a target
- Missclicks are also counted, so be careful where you point your mouse
- You can Pause, Continue, or Quit the game
- There is also a scoreboard in the top left corner to know how you are performing
## Why does it exist?
I created this small project as part of a university assignment in the third semester.
The main objective was to create a small Java **graphical desktop application** maintaining the **MVC pattern** and using a variety of different techniques.
### Some of the techniques used:
- Java Timers for controlling the target objects
- Java streams for better code readability
- Java Swing for the graphical components
- Model View Controller pattern
- basic OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance
